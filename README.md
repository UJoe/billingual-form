# billingual-form
This code is part of a bigger application of mine. It creates a responsive form in the selected language (English or Hungarian) and validates the inputs. Iff each field is completed well, the new user is added to the database and the global user object. It also includes my universal JS function "message", by which you can easily display texts and disappearing warnings in any language anywhere on the screen.
